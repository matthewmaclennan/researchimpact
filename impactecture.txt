BOK --> id the components, connections and interactions of a specific process
Classifications --> Delineating the different types of things under a topic
Assessment --> Method of measuring a quality in a thing or process, mediated by a framework

Impact is a difference in q(A) due to a(B) as judged by fC.
q(A) = Quality of A
a(B,A) = Action of B on A
fC( ) = Framework of C
t1 = time point 1
t2 = time point 2

Essentially -->
fC( )
A
B
a( )
t
Sampling plan to determine t points
fC[a(B,A)]_t1 = q(A)_t1
fC[a(B,A)]_t2 = q(A)_t2
IF {q(A)_t2  -  q(A)_t1  =/=  0} THEN {Probability of Impact is high}

Time dependence needs to be assessed: If the d(a(B,A))/dt is too large, then t2-t1 overlooks important dynamics. 
Especially since research has a long gestation period relative to the actions and exigencies of society. If the "ease of analysis" 
is high, then the object can be analyzed at a high frequency.
